Meshlab can output meshes as JSON formatted triangle and vertex data.
We need to convert this into the triangle format used for the Arduino3D 
models.


Workflow:

1. Open model in MeshLab
2. Repair and edit mesh as necessary
3. Simplify mesh, no more than 256 vertices or triangles! 
    Realistically, only models with <100 triangles will work well on the Arduino
    (suggest using MeshLab's quadratic edge collapse decimation routine)
4. Recompute vertex, face normals (if needed)
5. Export as .json data
6. Convert to C datastructures:
    `cat model.json | ./convert_json_to_triangles.py >> model.h`
7. This can compute the vertices, faces, edges, face normals, and vertex normals. 
    Depending on the desired rendering mode, we may not need all of this data. 
    Unnecessary data can be deleted.
